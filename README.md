arena rest mobile GUI 
------------------

This is a fork of this official example react app for Resolume Arena REST API 

https://gitlab.resolume.com/public-resolume/arena-rest-triggered

I use this project to learn the Resolume Arena API and to build a custom mobile phone web app GUI for Arena for my own uses. 

I modified it to :

- use TalwindCSS as CSS framework for easier and faster Styling

- optimize layout for mobile phone devices portrait , so use it on a such device or on desktop in mobile emulation mode ( dev Tools) 

- show up to 3 layers stacked
 
- allow horizinatal swipe touch scrolling between the layer clips using css snap API 

- add a button to clear the active clip in each layer

more features coming soon!

Feel free to contribute  improve or fork it .

If you do anything with it I'll be happy to hear.
